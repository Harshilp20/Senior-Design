## Project Abstract

The Windows Process Protector is an anti-cheat system designed to monitor and safeguard Windows application processes from unauthorized access. By leveraging techniques like memory protection, code integrity checks, and process monitoring, the system ensures secure and reliable application performance. The project includes a user-friendly web interface that allows users to monitor running processes, receive alerts about potential threats, and prevent malicious activities. This system prioritizes privacy and data security while addressing key challenges in cybersecurity and gaming fairness. Developed with a focus on professional growth, the project integrates knowledge from operating systems, software engineering, and real-world software development practices.

# Summary of Hours and Justification

### Harshil Patel

- Fall Semester Hours: 45 hrs
- Spring Semester Hours: 90 hrs
- Total Hours: 135 hrs

Justification:

Throughout the year, I worked extensively on designing and implementing major components of the Windows Process Protector. My efforts were focused on the memory protection module, code integrity checks, behavior analysis, and network monitoring subsystems. I led the development of the web interface and took charge of real-time dashboard features. I also handled testing for all subsystems and ensured the system performed reliably under real-world scenarios. I contributed equally to documentation and presentations, including the Final Report and Expo preparation. Tasks were verified through meeting notes and development logs in our GitHub repository.

### Bartosz Kawalkowski

- Fall Semester Hours: 45 hrs
- Spring Semester Hours: 100 hrs
- Total Hours: 145 hrs

Justification:

Over the course of the project, I led the system architecture design and core development of memory protection and code integrity verification modules. I performed in-depth research on Windows kernel security and anti-cheat strategies. I also developed much of the backend logic for the behavior and network monitoring subsystems. I was heavily involved in writing the technical specification and documentation. I contributed equally to design reviews, testing strategy, and final deliverables including the Final Design Report and Expo presentation.
