## Economical Constraints
Windows Process Protector is an anti-cheat system where several constraints must be considered. First, we must address that we are using a limited budget, this is an economic constraint that must be considered. Our team will be using open sourced tools, but this can limit our potential from implementing more advanced features that can further meet user needs.

## Legal Constraints
Our system actively monitors running processes, here we also must address legal constraints. We need to ensure our users that their data is protected, and we must follow privacy laws. We need to gain the user’s consent to collect their data and explain how it will be used in our system. This will help avoid any legal trouble in the future.

## Ethical Constraints
Again, since our system will be handling user data, we must protect this data. User’s will be concerned that their data will be misused but it is our job to ensure to the user that our system honors user privacy and does not keep any data.

## Socal Constraints
Our original goal for this system is to detect cheating in games. This can make gaming fair for everyone. This is where we must take social constraints into consideration. We need to ensure that our system is readily available for all users. Our system should be inclusive and people from all communities have access to it.
