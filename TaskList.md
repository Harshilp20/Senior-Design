2. Craft a blueprint for a memory guardian module to block unwanted access to safeguarded programs (Harshil Patel)
3. Build a memory sentinel to spot attempts at injecting foreign code (Bartosz Kawalkowski)
4. Put the memory guardian through its paces using mock cheating tactics (Harshil Patel)
5. Verify the memory shield holds strong against tricky edge cases and known cheat tricks (Harshil Patel)

## Code Integrity Subsystem
6. Explore existing ways to verify code integrity in process defense (Harshil Patel)
7. Map out a code authenticity checker to keep tabs on unaltered program code (Bartosz Kawalkowski)
8. Set up a hash verification system to ensure code purity in active processes (Bartosz Kawalkowski)
9. Run the code authenticity checker through various process scenarios (Harshil Patel)
10. Write up the ins and outs of the code integrity verification process (Bartosz Kawalkowski)

## Behavior Analysis Subsystem
11. Dig into patterns of cheating that the behavior watchdog should sniff out (Bartosz Kawalkowski)
12. Sketch out behavior patterns for keeping an eye on processes (Harshil Patel)
13. Craft a smart detection system within the behavior analysis module (Bartosz Kawalkowski)
14. Test drive the behavior watchdog to spot fishy process actions (Harshil Patel)
15. Fine-tune the detection algorithms based on what we learn from tests (Harshil Patel)

## Network Monitoring Subsystem
16. Look into ways to keep tabs on network traffic for signs of cheating (Harshil Patel)
17. Plan out a network behavior detective to track suspicious online activity (Bartosz Kawalkowski)
18. Build a network sentry to flag unauthorized outside connections (Harshil Patel)
19. Try out the network behavior detective with various online activities (Bartosz Kawalkowski)
20. Refine the network traffic rules to cut down on false alarms (Harshil Patel)
