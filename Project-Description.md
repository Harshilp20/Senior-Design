# Windows Process Protection System with Interactive Web Monitoring

## Project Overview

We are planning to develop a comprehensive process protection system for 64-bit Windows applications, coupled with a web-based monitoring interface. This ambitious undertaking represents the culmination of our computer science education, allowing us to apply theoretical knowledge and practical skills to create a sophisticated security solution.

## Key Features

- Robust anti-cheat system that goes beyond typical gaming applications
- Protection for any user-selected processes running on Windows machines
- Advanced techniques to prevent unauthorized access, including:
  - Memory protection
  - Code integrity checks
  - Prevention of DLL injection
  - Remote thread creation prevention
- Web-based monitoring component providing real-time insights and alerts

## Goals and Objectives

- Delve deeper into areas of cybersecurity and system-level programming
- Address real-world challenges in protecting sensitive software from malicious actors
- Gain valuable experience in developing low-level system software
- Create secure, efficient solutions for modern computing environments

## Expected Outcomes

Upon completion, we expect to have developed a robust process protection system capable of:

- Preventing unauthorized access to protected processes on Windows machines
- Detecting and preventing various cheating techniques, including memory manipulation, code editing, and DLL injection
- Providing real-time insights into protected processes through a user-friendly web interface
- Alerting users to potential threats

## Success Metrics

Success will be measured by:

- The system's ability to thwart common cheating methods
- Minimal impact on the performance of protected processes
- Ease of use and integration of the web interface

## Personal Growth

Through this project, we aim to:

- Contribute to the advancement of computer security
- Refine our skills in system-level programming, cybersecurity, and web development
- Demonstrate our ability to tackle complex, real-world problems
- Deliver a high-quality solution showcasing our skills and knowledge acquired during our time at the University of Cincinnati
