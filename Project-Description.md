### Project Topic Area

## AI Powered Coding in VS Code
- We are planning to develop a VS Code extention that uses the OpenAI ChatGPT API
- The extension allows a user to create code using AI straight from VS Code
- The idea is to have the user input a prompt about the what they are trying to accomplish and code gets autogenerated and inserted into their files in VS Code with matching styles
- It also gives code suggestions and improvements
